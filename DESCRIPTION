Description: Nutrition is of utmost importance. To ease access to 
             nutritional data,the US Department of Agriculture(USDA)
             provides a number of free to use application programming interfaces(APIs). 
             The goal of 'rfdc' is to therefore utilize this data to provide a very easy to use yet robust interface to FoodData Central in R.
