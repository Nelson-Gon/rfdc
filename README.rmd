# Background

This repository is intended to serve as a replacement to the R package [usdar](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/usdar). This was necessary because the former API is slated for End of Life as explained in issue [#2](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/usdar/issues/2). 

It is also based on [pyfdc](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/pyfdc)




**Installation**

To install the package, one requires to have `devtools` installed. The package is not on CRAN and the author does not intend to push it  to CRAN unless specific need arises.

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("Nelson-Gon/rfdc")

```

**Loading the package**

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(rfdc)

```


**Initial Setup**

As a first step, we need to set an API key for the session via `set_api_key` as shown below.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
set_api_key("key_here")

```

To signup for an API key:

```{r,eval=FALSE}

key_signup()

```

**Initialise an object**

To intialise an object, we can use `make_object`. See details about each class below. For instance, to initialise an object of class `FoodSearch` with the search term `indomie`:


```{r,eval=FALSE}

my_object <- make_object("FoodSearch",search_phrase="indomie")

```



**Classes**

1. `FoodSearch` class


This class allows access to the food search [endpoint](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html) i.e to search/query the database. 

**Available methods**

1. `get_food_info`

To get details about our object above:


```{r,eval=FALSE}

get_food_info(my_object,"description")


```

To get multiple details:

```{r,eval=FALSE}

get_food_info(my_object,c("description",'fdcId','score'))


```

Another example:

```{r,eval=FALSE}

head(get_food_info(test,c('fdcId','description','score')))

 

```

Further exploration is left to the user.
